# Farming

Grow crops, harvest them, sell them for money. Farming has its own dedicated equipment, which can be upgraded and enchanted. <br>
Crops can be grown in a variety of ways, including in the ground, in pots, and in greenhouses.
Crops can be used to craft different things that help you with fishing, farming, or other activities.

## How it works:

<strong>Seeds</strong> planted take time to grow, once grown, the default return in 1 crop and a 20% change of getting another seed. <br>
Seeds can be gained from the shop or from harvesting crops. <br>
