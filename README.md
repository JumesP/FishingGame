# FishingGame - Pre-Release (WIP)
My new fishing game!

This is a simple fishing game that I am creating to learn more about the SERN Stack!

WIP!

### The Website is accessable at the following link:

## This project is created using:
**Backend**
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- SQLite3
- TypeScript
- REST API

**Frontend**
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- Storybook

## This project includes:
- User Authentication
- Cookies

## Project Description:

### Viewing Fishes
You can view the fishes in the tank. The fishes are all caught by the users.

### Catch Fish
You can catch fish, which are randomly generated depending on the equipment you have equipped. You can either keep the fish or sell it for money.

### Manage Fishes and Equipment
You can manage the fishes in your tank and the equipment you have equipped.

### User Authentication
You can create an account, login, and logout. The user data is stored in a SQLite3 database.

## How to run the project:

Simply clone the repository and run the following commands:

```git clone https://github.com/JumesP/FishingGame.git```

Then:

```cd FishingGame```

Inside the root directory, there are 2 folders, one for the frontend and one for the backend. You will need to run the following commands within 2 separate terminals:

Terminal 1 (backend):

```cd server```

```npm install``` (only the first time)

```npm run dev```

Terminal 2 (frontend):

```cd client```

```npm install``` (only the first time)

```npm run dev```

Then you can access the website at:

**http://localhost:3000**
